		<h3><center>This is my Mom</center></h3>
		<h3><center>Her job is to take dubs all day</center><h3>
		<h3><center>Her preferred method of transport is the Battle Bus</center></h3>
		<h3><center>Will Game End You</center></h3>
		<h3><center>Had a game made after her, you might not have heard of it, but it is called Fortnite</h3></center>
		<h3><center>A rival company stole her idea and created the game PUBG, a stupid game with stupid graphics that make it unrealistic</h3></center>
		<h3><center>Now let me tell you a story about my mother...one day she got a 52 kill game and was doing super epic and was about to take the fat dub, until the one-and-only Ninja joined the game. Ninja went straight for the tactical, Boogie Bomb to try and take the dub, but then she did a 360 No-Scope and Game Ended him. The End.
