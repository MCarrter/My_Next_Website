		<h3><center>This is my good friend Buddy Bot</center></h3>
		<h3><center>He owns the local In-N-Out</center><h3>
		<h3><center>His father is Brobot, who used to be cool until he dabbed</center></h3>
		<h3><center>After this catastrophe, he was shunned by everyone and banished to the Shadow Realm</center></h3>
		<h3><center>Buddy Bot knows how to fly and has a built-in missile launcher</h3></center>
		<h3><center>He is a competitive Krunker player with every skin in the game</h3></center>
		<h3><center>One day when he was working at In-N-Out, a kid slammed the doors open, challenging him to a game of Krunker. Buddy Bot accepted this challenge, completely wrecking the kid on the spot and game ending him. Nobody ever challenged him again, so everyone just calls him the master of Krunker because everyone is too afraid.</center></h3>

		<h3>My father is the mayor/dictator of Sombertown</h3>
		<h3>His real name is Burgermeister Meisterburger</h3>

		<h3>Enjoys outlawing toys as a "hobby"</h3>
		<h3>Him and Kris Kringle fought to the death once, but Kringle's power of toys defeated my father. Kris Kringle spared him, making everyone think he was a cool dude, but my father new otherwise. He plots his revenge to this day, waiting for the day he can rule a world without toys.</h3>
